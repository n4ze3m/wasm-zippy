# Zippy

Create archive files from browser withouth sending files to third party servers. Zippy is a open source project created by using WebAssembly. 


## Installation


Zippy use golang for webassembly. You can clone the repository and run the following for build the binary.

```bash
bash build.sh
```

For testing web application, you can use any tool for that. I recommend to use `serve` package from vercel.


## Anythings else?

Hmm yeah, I will add more features soon. Like unzip archive files view, and so on. Also other archive formats like raw, tar etc will be added.
